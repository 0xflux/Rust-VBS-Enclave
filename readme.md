# Rust VBS VTL1 Secure Enclave

This project is to compliment a post on my [blog](https://fluxsec.red/creating-a-rust-application-running-in-vtl1)
where I show you how to build a usermode VTL0 application which loads a DLL into a VBS VTL1 
secure enclave.

`enclave_host` is the VTL0 application.

`vbs_enclave` is the VTL1 DLL.
